Testing the offense/defense vectors as ranking vectors for a positive
reciprocal 100x100 matrix A.  The vector are the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvector f=o+id of B=log(A) corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue.
Sometime we will use the ranking including the imaginary part of the
corresponding eigenvalue, r.

Offense/defense score for B without eigenvalue	 82.218004
Offense/defense score for B with eigenvalue	 82.718004
Offense/defense score for A without eigenvalue	 9085.015905
Offense/defense score for A with eigenvalue	 9085.018573
Ratio score for A using f	 9084.110099
Ratio score for A using abs(f)	 9084.035654
Ratio score for A using perron vector	 9079.294703
