Testing the offense/defense vectors as ranking vectors for a positive
reciprocal 100x100 matrix A.  The vector are the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvector f=o+id of B=log(A) that minimizes ||B-\lambda*f*ctranspose(f)||.
Sometime we will use the ranking including the imaginary part of the
corresponding eigenvalue, r.

Offense/defense score for B without eigenvalue	 84.130499
Offense/defense score for B with eigenvalue	 84.130499
Offense/defense score for A without eigenvalue	 2041.251355
Offense/defense score for A with eigenvalue	 2041.249989
Ratio score for A using f	 2049.264688
Ratio score for A using abs(f)	 2043.121660
Ratio score for A using perron vector	 2034.854445
