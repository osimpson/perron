Testing the offense/defense vectors as ranking vectors for a positive
reciprocal 100x100 matrix A.  The vector are the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvector f=o+id of B=log(A) that minimizes ||B-\lambda*f*ctranspose(f)||.
Sometime we will use the ranking including the imaginary part of the
corresponding eigenvalue, r.

Offense/defense score for B without eigenvalue	 83.234763
Offense/defense score for B with eigenvalue	 83.234763
Offense/defense score for A without eigenvalue	 5894.794318
Offense/defense score for A with eigenvalue	 5894.600034
Ratio score for A using f	 5896.381624
Ratio score for A using abs(f)	 5893.687331
Ratio score for A using perron vector	 5880.740868
