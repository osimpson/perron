Testing the offense/defense vectors as ranking vectors for a positive
reciprocal 100x100 matrix A.  The vector are the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvector f=o+id of B=log(A) that minimizes ||B-\lambda*f*ctranspose(f)||.
Sometime we will use the ranking including the imaginary part of the
corresponding eigenvalue, r.

Offense/defense score for B without eigenvalue	 83.298703
Offense/defense score for B with eigenvalue	 83.298703
Offense/defense score for A without eigenvalue	 371.791238
Offense/defense score for A with eigenvalue	 371.815899
Ratio score for A using f	 372.021176
Ratio score for A using abs(f)	 350.088149
Ratio score for A using perron vector	 352.325493
