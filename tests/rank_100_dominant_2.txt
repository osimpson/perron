Testing the offense/defense vectors as ranking vectors for a positive
reciprocal 100x100 matrix A.  The vector are the real and imaginary parts of
the eigenvector f=o+id of B=log(A) corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue.
Sometime we will use the ranking including the imaginary part of the
corresponding eigenvalue, r.

Offense/defense score for B without eigenvalue	 81.939376
Offense/defense score for B with eigenvalue	 82.439376
Offense/defense score for A without eigenvalue	 1399.102875
Offense/defense score for A with eigenvalue	 1399.096326
Ratio score for A using f	 1398.467430
Ratio score for A using abs(f)	 1397.635460
Ratio score for A using perron vector	 1395.173846
